My project includes a collection of haikus that have to do with tha changing of the seasons.
The process I use in order to coplete this assignment was creating multiple html files on the brackets application
and linking them, I then connected the last page to the first page in order to make the assignemnt continious.
The intention I had by creating this assignemnt was to demonstrate my knowledge of the material we were taught in class
and how to apply it.
